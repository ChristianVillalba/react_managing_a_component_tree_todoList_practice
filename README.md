# React: Managing A Component Tree - To-Do List practice
Created with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)  
Notes from: React module  
[The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)  
Instructor: Dr. Angela Yu 

## Description
This app is a To-Do List consisting of:
* A heading "To-Do List".
* Form:
  * An Input text that allows us to write the our task.
  * An Add Button that adds the new task to the list of pending tasks.
* An unoreded list with our pending tasks.

In this practice, the Form will be extracted as a Component (InputArea.jsx)

## What I have learned with this project:

* How to manage state in a Parent Component  
* Separate App in different Components
  * Stateless Component
  * Props
* Manage State in individual components
  *  Inline Styling, 
  *  Conditional Rendering
  *  Ternary Operators 
  *  Event Handling and 
  *  Using State
  *  Arrow Statement
* How state is handled across the app and components
  *  An Individual Component changing its Parent Component
     *  Component from ToDoItem.jsx changing the items Array in App.jsx
  *  How to target the specific item from a list (JS Array) 
  *  Difference: Passing Funtions or Calling Functions   
     *  Map , Filter & Reduce will expect functions insideo of them `() => {}`
     *  Otherwise , they will be called immediately
     *  Map , Filter & Reduce return an output
* Functional programming is hard.
  * Difficult things take a long time.
  * No retreat, no surrender.
